\section{Intensity of single source - Diffraction}

Using python, I plotted distance vs. intensity for a single source. The relevant python code can be found in appendix \ref{code:single}.

As it should be, Intensity decreases by increasing the distance. Where at the position where source is placed we have high intensity peak.

\section{Intensity of linear array of 4 antennae}

Plot between distance and intensity, for four antenna sources arrange in a linear array and by managing phase between them, we get interference pattern. The relevant code can be found in appendix \ref{code:four}.
