\chapter{Summary \& Conclusion}

To search for the hidden mysteries of the universe, one should understand the way the universe communicates. The universe speaks in the form of signals of different frequencies.

If we want to understand these signals, the first and foremost requirement is that we should have these in their most accurate form, but unfortunately due to large distances we are not able to receive them in an accurate form as they spread wider and wider and lose strength. So we need to build up a setup to collect and also send signals with high intensity to achieve our goal.

Beam forming is a technique to form a beam with high intensity, by using multiple antenna sources that works as a single high gain antenna which is hard to build up. By this technique we can focus signals in our desired direction and this is done by managing phased between all the antenna sources. Beam forming works same at both transmitting and receiving ends.

In this thesis, after all the derivations, calculations and simulations, Fig. (\ref{fig:phase_1}) and (\ref{fig:phase_2}) shows that by introducing and managing phase among multiple antenna sources, we can form and steer the beam by the interference of all the radiations coming from each individual antenna source.

We can form a stronger and narrower beam by using a large number of antenna sources with correctly chosen phase relation amongst themselves.
