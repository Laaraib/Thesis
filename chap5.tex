\chapter{Summary \& Conclusion}

Fig. (4.3) and (4.4) shows that by introducing and managing phase among multiple antenna sources, we can steer the beam formed by the interference of all the radiations coming from each individual antenna source.

we can form a better and narrow beam with higher intensity by using number of antenna sources with correct phase relation.
