\chapter{Summary \& Conclusion}

To search for the hidden mysteries of the universe, one should understand the way this universe communicate. Universe speaks in the form of signals of different frequencies.

If we want to understand these signals, the first and foremost requirement is that we should have these in their most accurate form, but unfortunately due to large distances we are not able to have them in a well accurate form as they get wider and wider with losing strength. So, here we need to build up a setup to collect and also send signals with high intensity to achieve our goal.

Beam forming is a technique to form a beam with high intensity, by using multiple antenna sources that works as a single high gain antenna which is hard to build up. By this technique we can focus signals in our desired direction and this is done by managing phased between all the antenna sources. Beam forming works same at both transmitting and receiving ends.

In this thesis, after all the calculations, Fig. (4.3) and (4.4) shows that by introducing and managing phase among multiple antenna sources, we can form and steer the beam by the interference of all the radiations coming from each individual antenna source.

we can form a better and narrow beam with higher intensity by using number of antenna sources with correct phase relation.
