\abstract{To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used;
	
One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change the direction of the radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an aperture antenna.
	
And second technique, is to use multiple antennas to form a directed beam (beam forming) which involves the operations of phase shifting and amplitude tapering for each element, this is called phased array antenna, or antenna array. Depending upon their geometry we have different configuration of arrays for e.g linear, circular and complex array.
	
By using the second technique, My task was to construct the plot between intensity and lateral distance, for multiple antenna sources arranged in a linear array and by managing only the phase between them to produce a directed beam (one with maximum intensity at a location of my choice).}
