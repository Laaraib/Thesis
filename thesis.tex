\abstract{%
To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change the direction of the radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an aperture antenna.

The second technique is to use multiple antennas to form a directed beam (beam forming) which involves the operations of phase shifting and amplitude tapering for each element; this is called a phased array antenna, or antenna array. Depending upon their geometry we have different configurations of arrays for example linear, circular and complex array.
	
This project used the second technique to derive, calculate and simulate the directed beam (one with maximum intensity at a location of my choice) created by multiple antenna sources arranged in a linear array with the freedom to manage only the phase between them.
